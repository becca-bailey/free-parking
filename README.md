#Free Parking

Free parking was a mock client project made by Phase-3 students in Dev Bootcamp.

This site was designed, by client request, as a way to for users to organize and review board games as well as create gaming groups. If a user creates or joins a group, they will be able to see if someone in their group owns a game that they are looking up. If a group-admin wishes to invite another user to their group, they can use an automated e-mail invite system.
